# Deeplab v3+ for semantic segmentation in digital elevation models and its derivative

In this project, deeplab v3+ is used to explore semantic segmentation task in digital elevation models and its derivatives. 
The goal is to detect historical man-made structures such as bomb craters, charcoal kilns, barrows, and mine shafts in 
archaeological sites. The code for the model is borrowed and edited from:
